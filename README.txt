Haar Wavelet Transformation Program

To Use:
Execute Wavelet.jar from the command line using the following protocol:

Place image in bin folder.

To convert an image:
>> java -jar Wavelet.jar convert [image file name]

To inverse/revert an image:
>> java -jar Wavelet.jar revert [image file name]

In both instances, the program will create a new image file named wavelet_output.bmp containing the converted image.

The program has only been verified to run correctly using square black and white images with side lengths of powers of 2.
